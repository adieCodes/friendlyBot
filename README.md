\[InsertNameHere\] is intended to be a bot-style iPhone app for easy
integration with productivity software, with an additional browser
interface for account management and data management. It is aimed at
sole traders, partnerships or small business with fewer than 10
employees.

Its key design principles are:

-   a simple message style user interface similar to WhatsApp.
-   natural language style.
-   highly flexible and user configurable.
-   thin client using minimal resource in the device.
-   secure, encrypted data transfer.
-   fast download and setup

The app should have the following functionality:

-   \[Phase 1\] simple note-taking capability (native app, html notes
    accessed via browser).
-   \[Phase 1\] simple expenses tracking (integration with native
    library based on MongoDB or SQL, exports CSV file for Excel or other
    spreadsheet).
-   \[Phase 1\] automated expense reports.
-   \[Phase 2\] option of integrating notes with EverNote.
-   \[Phase 2\] post items to Google Calendar as reminders.
-   \[Phase 2\] native timesheet app for recording work and billing.
-   \[Phase 3\] integration with Sage or Quickbooks.
-   \[Phase 4\] Photo recognition of receipts.

## Additional features
		
- Autocomplete suggestions whilst typing. Could be options, categories for expenses, dates, etc. Would simplify user experience and the data we need to handle
- Siri integration
- Note/expenses sharing (could even have overarching project encompassing all staff, ala GitHub)

## Potential issues

* Creating a login system. I’d like to tackle this one if that's ok. Spoke to Daryl in passing the other day he suggested it’s challenging, so we might need a fair amount of time to implement this.

## Working environment (for want of a better term)

- Follow industry best practises and document to share with potential employers as part of project - Scrum, Kanban (open trello board)
- Agree linting rules, commit message style, etc. Happy to be told I’m being a jobsworth but my feelings are that this will ensure our codebase has consistency to make development easier and  messy code/commits could put employers off.

## Next steps

[ ] Whiteboard app to allow us to crystallise the idea and better see opportunities/risk before completing the overview to James?
